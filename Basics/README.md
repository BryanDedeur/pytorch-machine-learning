# Getting started

Introduction to tensors



## Part 1 - Introduction to tensors 

### Terms

1. Tensor - is an array that can be used on the GPU to accelerate computing.
2. Tuple - set of related static values that can be defined as a object
3. CUDA Tensors - can be moved to any device
4. NumPy Bridge - converts numpy arrays and tensors

### Questions

- How does a GPU array accelerate computing?
- What kind of devices is CUDA Tensors referring to? GPU CPU or

## Part 2 - Automatic Differentiation

### Terms

1. autograd package - provides operations for tensors in a defined by run framework.
2. define by run framework - how your code is run and that every iteration can be different.

### Questions

- In terms of data structures, is autograd like a tree of the matrix a as operations are preformed.

## Part 3 - Neural Networks

### Terms

1. Convolutions
2. Subsampling
3. Full connection
3. Gaussian connections
4. Learnable Parameters (weights)
5. Loss function
6. Backward propagation

### Theory

Define the network -> process inputs, call backwards -> compute the loss -> update the weights
