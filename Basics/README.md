# Getting started

## Tensors
Tensor is an array that can be used on the GPU to accelerate computing. 

```
from __future__ import print_function
import torch
```

tensors are defined by the class object "torch" followed by the "method" with appropriate arguments

- How does a GPU array accelerate computing?
